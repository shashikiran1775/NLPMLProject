Hi! This is Karthick! Checkout below to see my progress!!

**CVE data extraction from cve.mitre.org**
* cve-allitems.csv - contains all the CVE IDs from CVRF-XML format available in https://cve.mitre.org/data/downloads/allitems-cvrf.xml.
* Generate cve-allitems.csv.py - python script used to extract the data and convert it to CSV (Changes can be made to the script to add or modify more columns).
* CVE-Search.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with practice use of Ares (Package) to extarct data and a dummy model developed on the extracted data for testing and some fun :)
